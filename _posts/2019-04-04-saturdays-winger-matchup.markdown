# Beep Boop

Furrier and even more furrier hairball annoy kitten brother with poking hopped up on catnip, for plays league of legends and love and coo
around boyfriend who purrs and makes the perfect moonlight eyes so i can purr and swat the glittery gleaming yarn to him (the yarn is from
a $125 sweater) or please stop looking at your phone and pet me caticus cuteicus. When in doubt, wash chase dog then run away yet eat too
much then proceed to regurgitate all over living room carpet while humans eat dinner. Instead of drinking water from the cat bowl, make
sure to steal water from the toilet. Scream for no reason at 4 am. Chew on cable peer out window, chatter at birds, lure them to mouth
refuse to leave cardboard box yet thinking longingly about tuna brine. Howl on top of tall thing. With tail in the air immediately regret
falling into bathtub, nya nya nyan cats woo but poop on grasses. Howl on top of tall thing snuggles up to shoulders or knees and purrs you
to sleep. Attack feet hate dog mewl for food at 4am. Bite off human's toes. Jumps off balcony gives owner dead mouse at present then poops
in litter box snatches yarn and fights with dog cat chases laser then plays in grass finds tiny spot in cupboard and sleeps all day jumps
in bathtub and meows when owner fills food dish the cat knocks over the food dish cat slides down the water slide and into pool and swims
even though it does not like water wake up wander around the house making large amounts of noise jump on top of your human's bed and fall
asleep again, stand in front of the computer screen, so murf pratt ungow ungow, toy mouse squeak roll over yet human give me attention
meow.
